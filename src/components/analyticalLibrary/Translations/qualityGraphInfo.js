        <h6>Bugs</h6>
        <p>
          Bugs can be syntax or logic errors within the source code of a program.
          These are issues that represents something wrong in the code. 
          However, if errors are not caught before the program is compiled into
          the final application, the bugs will be noticed by the user.
        </p>
       
        <h6>Vulnerabilities</h6>
        <p>
          A vulnerability, in information technology (IT), is a flaw in code or
          design that creates a potential point of security compromise for an
          endpoint or network. Vulnerabilities create possible attack vectors, through which an
          intruder could run code or access a target system's memory.
        </p>
       <p>
          A vulnerability may also refer to any type of weakness in a computer
          system itself, in a set of procedures, or in anything that leaves
          information security exposed to a threat.
        </p>
        <h6>Code Smells</h6>
        <p>
          A code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program
          that possibly indicates a deeper problem. It can be considered something that is
          syntactically correct but not efficient
        </p>
      <p>
          For e.g, A function that is very long and has too many loops or
          iterating statements which gives us the desired result.
        </p>

  "Coverage": `
    <div>
        <p>
          Code coverage is a measure which describes the degree of which the
          source code of the program has been tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one form of white box testing which finds the areas of the
          program not exercised by a set of test cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also creates some test cases to increase coverage and determining a
          quantitative measure of code coverage
        </p>
        <p>
          It also combines that with source code information to generate a
          report about the test suite's code coverage.

  "Outstanding Bugs": `
   <div>
        <p>
          A defect is an error or a bug, in an application. A
          programmer while designing and building the software can make mistakes
          or error. These mistakes or errors mean that there are flaws in the software which leads to a defect.
          When actual result deviates from the expected result while testing a
          software application or product then it results into a defect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, any deviation from the specification mentioned in the product
          functional specification document is a defect. In different
          organizations it’s called differently like bug, issue, incidents or
          problem.

  "Average Defect Resolution Time": `      <div>
  <p>
    Number of defects closed on a particular day for the project along
    with the average resolution time taken for the bugs to be closed.
  </p>
  <p>
    It projects the pace of defect resolution for the project along with
    the number of defects.
